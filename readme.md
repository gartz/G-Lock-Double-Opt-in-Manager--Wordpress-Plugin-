**IMPORTANT: PHP 5 required!**

This mailing list management plugin allows the visitors of your blog subscribe to your mailing list using a double opt-in method. The plugin sends an email with the subscription confirmation link to the user and if the user confirms the subscription, it sends a welcome email to each new subscriber. The details of new subscribers are saved to the internal WordPress database. You can <a href="http://www.glockeasymail.com/wordpress-email-newsletter-plugin-for-double-opt-in-subscription/" title="create double opt-in mailing list">manage the mailing list inside WordPress</a> and export the list for the further use in your <a href="http://www.glockeasymail.com/" title="bulk email marketing software">email marketing software</a>. You can also use the plugin to convert your blog RSS feed into an email newsletter and send it out to your subscribers. You can design the style and content of your email newsletter yourself and you can schedule your email broadcast weekly, monthly or as soon as you add a certain number of new posts to your blog.
